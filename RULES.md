**Rules**

1. Your behaviour matters. Don't harass or stalk users/moderators of our discord server. Don't bait people with obnoxious behavior or pollute the chat with pages of personal beef.
2. No Spam of any kind outside of #shitposting.
3. No self-advertisement unless it happened out of a conversation, linking your stream when someone asks about or having it in your profile it is fine, but don't come in here selling your products. Ask a mod first.
4. Text Channels are english only, don't hold conversation in other languages (occasional single words or talking about another language is fine).
5. No hate speech (e.g. racism, nazism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, antisemitism). Bad words are auto-filtered and will result in perma-mutes.
6. Don't encourage, advertise, or participate in raiding of Discord Servers, Twitch Streams, or other social media.
7. Don't break the Discord Rules of Conduct or Discord Community Guidelines. THIS INCLUDES DOXXING/IP SHIT. Including memes - we **cannot** read your mind to know your intent.
8. No ERP or forcing your kinks onto others. This basically boils down to: keep your kinks to yourself (this includes furries).
9. Don't encourage or spread the ToS-breaking Twitch streams.
10. No shady/scam links. Link shorteners, QR codes, shady links, etc. may result in a warning or mute depending on the case. We won't click on them to check.
11. No NSFW or Shock content. This includes adult content, puke/shit videos or images, Earrape videos, epilepsy emotes/gifs, extreme physical harm, very grotesque imagery etc.
12. Discord stickers are prohibited in most channels. If your sticker gets autoremoved, take that as a hint.
13. Circumventing mod-actions may result in a ban. If you're warned about your behaviour take it as a hint that you should stop whatever you're doing.
14. Don't tell people to kill themselves (essentially rule 1 & rule 5). Whether through saying "kys" or "kill yourselves" or "kys (keep yourself safe)" whether in text or in images.

We try to keep mute durations as uniform as possible, but it will vary depending on activity of the user (new user or not), severity of the offense, previous infractions and overall behaviour of the user.

Trying to circumvent the exact wording of the rules on purpose may result in it being judged as a normal rule break.

Don't break channel-specific rules (some channels have extra rules listed in their channel topic. Updates to channel rules are posted in pins).
