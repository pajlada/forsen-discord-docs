**Rules**

1. Your behaviour matters. Don't harass or stalk users/moderators of our discord server. Don't bait people with obnoxious behavior or pollute the chat with pages of personal beef.
2. No Spam of any kind outside of #shitposting.
3. Don't break channel-specific rules (some channels have extra rules listed in their channel topic. Updates to channel rules are posted in pins).
4. Text Channels are english only, don't hold conversation in other languages (occasional single words or talking about another language is fine).
5. No hate speech (e.g. racism, nazism, homophobia, sexism, transphobia, antisemitism). Bad words are auto-filtered and will result in perma-mutes.
6. Don't encourage, advertise, or participate in raiding of Discord Servers or Twitch Streams.
7. Don't break the Discord Rules of Conduct or Discord Community Guidelines.
8. No ERP or forcing your kinks onto others. This basically boils down to: keep your kinks to yourself (this includes furries).
9. Don't encourage or spread the ToS-breaking Twitch streams.
10. No shady/scam links. Link shorteners, QR codes, shady links, etc. may result in a warning or mute depending on the case. We won't click on them to check.
11. No adult content allowed.
12. Discord stickers are prohibited in most channels. If your sticker gets autoremoved, take that as a hint.

These rules apply to images and voice chat too
